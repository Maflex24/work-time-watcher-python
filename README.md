# work-time-watcher-python
It's simple console script to monitoring my worktime.

Script save and read data to/from .json file, so I have some kind of local database. 

Some ideas for future:
- add possibility to get worktime value from all week, month, maybe year by simple comments.
- add tasks - then I can know how many time I used to specyfic task
- maybe connect this program with some simple task manager/to do list
